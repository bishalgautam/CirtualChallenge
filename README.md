@Cirtual Coding Challenge  


 1. I am using MAMP on my end so you may need to download similar MySQl and PHP runing software.You can create a database and  use dataload.sql file to load the data.   

2. Once done, find the private/db_credentials.php where you may need to change the username, password and db_name for the database.

3. Load the main page public/index.php. Enjoy !!! :) 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* [X] I spent most of the time to figure out the CSS. I do not have good hands on in CSS so the UI/UX is not very nice.


Thanks
